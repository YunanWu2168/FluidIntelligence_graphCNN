# Environment
The tensorlfow version to run the model is Tensorflow 1.14.  (will upgrade to Tensorflow 2.0+ in the near future)
And you can install the packages that are needed in any version


# Model Running
You can open any of the jupyter notebook to run the model. 
We have detailed instructions inside the jupyter notebook.

After you download the pre-processed dataset in [link]{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V2Hth1TRtbY3McGU38VfKDtQ_du7-nMQ?usp=sharing}. 
You can train models on two dataset, HCP and ABCD and on different structures, All, cortical-only and subcortical-only.
