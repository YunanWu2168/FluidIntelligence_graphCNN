# Environment
The tensorlfow version to run the model is Tensorflow 1.14.  (will upgrade to Tensorflow 2.0+ in the near future)
And you can install the packages that are needed in any version


# Model Running
You can open any of the jupyter notebook to run the model. 
We have detailed instructions inside the jupyter notebook.


The raw data set analyzed for the current study is directly downloaded from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) S1200 data (https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-releases) and the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study (https://nda.nih.gov/abcd).

After you download the pre-processed dataset in [link]{https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V2Hth1TRtbY3McGU38VfKDtQ_du7-nMQ?usp=sharing} using FreeSurfer. 
You can train models on two dataset, HCP and ABCD and on different structures, All, cortical-only and subcortical-only.
